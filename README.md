# Project Title - Suicide Data
In this project, suicide data was analysed. This was done by importing data from an excel worksheet. The python file analysed the top
suicide rates in different countries and years. Further analysis was conducted by comparing genders to see which gender has higher suicide rates.
Using different functions and methods, the average suicide number was calculated in the different age groups within the data set.



## Process of the Project
1) Read the file on python by importing the excel file
2) Functions were created
3) Methods were created 
4) After each method was created, a COMMIT was issued onto Git
5) Once the project is completed, this was deployed on GitHub


### Modules used
In the suicide file reader, load_workbook was imported from openyxl. This was done to import the excel file into python in order to carry out
the analysis. A suicide_functions python file was created where all the functions and methods was created. In another python file, these methods
were run by importing everything from the suicide_functions file.
